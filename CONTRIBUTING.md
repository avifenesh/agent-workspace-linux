# Contributing

Thanks for taking a look. This project is pre-1.0, so small focused changes with
strong evidence are much easier to review than broad rewrites.

## Prerequisites

You need:

- **Rust toolchain** — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **System dependencies** (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt install xvfb openbox xdotool xauth x11-utils imagemagick xclip \
    bubblewrap pkg-config libxkbcommon-x11-dev
```

## Build

```bash
cargo build --locked
cargo run -- doctor   # quick self-check
```

## Quality Gates

Run all four gates before pushing:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
git diff --check
```

All four gates must pass. PRs that fail any gate will not be merged.

## Integration Smoke Test

For changes that touch runtime behaviour — MCP tool handling, permissions,
workspace control, viewer lifecycle, browser integration, or release gates — also
run the integration smoke:

```bash
scripts/integration_smoke.sh
```

When a real GPUI viewer is already open and you do not want the smoke to open a
second monitor:

```bash
AGENT_WORKSPACE_NO_NEW_VIEWER=1 scripts/integration_smoke.sh
```

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs small and focused on a single concern.
- Include evidence that the change works: test output, smoke run excerpt, or
  `doctor` output as appropriate.
- Describe what changed and why; reviewers should not have to guess intent.
- All four gates plus `scripts/integration_smoke.sh` must pass for any change
  touching runtime behaviour.

## Release Model

Releases are tagged manually. A human final-diff review of all changes precedes
any version tag. There is no automated release cut.

## Public Hygiene

- Do not commit `target/`, `.codex/`, copied browser profiles, local MCP config,
  real account data, or generated release evidence.
- Keep browser/account dogfood reports metadata-only. Raw logged-in page text,
  links, headings, and account details do not belong in tracked files.
- Keep default MCP usage clean: no `--permissions` means no MCP-level ceiling;
  locked permission mode is opt-in through an explicit permissions file.
- Prefer repo-owned MCP/CLI evidence over host browser bridges or external
  automation when validating this runtime.
